## **PhD Research Project**

  Articular cartilage experiences daily loading/unloading cycles that influence its biophysical and biochemical properties. These are associated with circadian rhythms of activity/rest. Indeed, autonomous circadian clocks have been found in mouse cartilage as well as in human primary chondrocytes. Disruption of circadian clocks in chondrocytes has been associated with cartilage degeneration in both mice and humans. Moreover, circadian rhythms become dampened during ageing and chronic inflammation.

  The circadian clock is involved in the temporal orchestration of several molecular networks involved in the daily maintenance of cartilage homeostasis (e.g. matrix synthesis and chondrocyte proliferation). In my PhD project, I am investigating the feasibility of utilising temperature pulses to restore circadian oscillations in cartilage. I am also evaluating the effect of the temperature treatment on tissue homeostasis.   

## **MSc Research Project**

 Multiprotein transport systems have been thoroughly studied in proteobacteria. However, knowledge about these assemblies in cyanobacteria remains scarce, even regarding the identity of the molecular components. For my Master’s dissertation, I focused on the characterisation of multiprotein transport complexes in _Synechocystis_ sp. PCC 6803.

My research helped to elucidate the complexity of TolC-dependent secretion mechanisms, and the importance of these systems to counteract the detrimental effects exerted by compounds with antimicrobial activity on cell physiology. It also highlighted the existence of TolC-independent functions among some multidrug efflux components, suggesting these transport complexes have roles relevant to the physiology of bacteria that stretch beyond antimicrobial resistance.

In addition, I performed the molecular (whole-genome sequencing) and phenotypic characterisation of two _Synechocystis_ strains (unpublished).
