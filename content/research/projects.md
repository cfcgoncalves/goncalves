For my Masterâ€™s dissertation, I focused on the characterisation of multiprotein transport complexes in _Synechocystis_ sp. PCC 6803. In brief, my research helps to elucidate the functional complexity of TolC-dependent secretion mechanisms, and the importance of these systems to counteract the detrimental effects exerted by antimicrobial compounds on cell physiology. Furthermore, it also highlights the existence of TolC-independent functions among some multidrug efflux components, suggesting these transport complexes have roles relevant to the physiology of bacteria that stretch beyond antimicrobial resistance.
