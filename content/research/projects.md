## **MSc Research Project**

 Multiprotein transport systems have been thoroughly studied in proteobacteria. However, knowledge about these assemblies in cyanobacteria remains scarce, even regarding the identity of the molecular components. For my Master’s dissertation, I focused on the characterisation of multiprotein transport complexes in _Synechocystis_ sp. PCC 6803.

My research helped to elucidate the complexity of TolC-dependent secretion mechanisms, and the importance of these systems to counteract the detrimental effects exerted by compounds with antimicrobial activity on cell physiology. It also highlighted the existence of TolC-independent functions among some multidrug efflux components, suggesting these transport complexes have roles relevant to the physiology of bacteria that stretch beyond antimicrobial resistance.

In addition, I performed the molecular (whole-genome sequencing) and phenotypic characterisation of two _Synechocystis_ strains (unpublished).
