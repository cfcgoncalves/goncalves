I am a PhD candidate at the University of Manchester studying circadian rhythms in articular cartilage. In particular, I am interested in the interactions between the circadian clock and the extracellular matrix and how these impact cartilage in health and disease. My research is funded by a Wellcome Trust PhD studentship.
