My name is Cátia and I am PhD candidate in Molecular and Cell Biology at the University of Manchester. I work in {{< staticref "https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/researchers/qingjun-meng(3e76712d-7e17-413f-be5d-20921e415a0b).html" "newtab" >}}Qing-Jun Meng{{< /staticref >}}'s lab where I study circadian rhythms in articular cartilage. In particular, I am interested in the development of strategies to restore circadian oscillations in this tissue

 the interactions between the circadian clock and the extracellular matrix and how these impact cartilage in health and disease. My research is funded by a Wellcome Trust PhD studentship.

Previously, I was based at {{< staticref "https://www.i3s.up.pt/research-group.php?x=5" "newtab" >}}Paula Tamagnini{{< /staticref >}}'s lab where I conducted my BSc and MSc research training. In my MSc project, I focused on the identification and functional characterisation of multiprotein transport complexes in the cyanobacterium _Synechocystis_ sp. PCC 6803. As an undegraduate student, I undertook a research project that focused on the transcriptional regulation of genes related to the biosynthesis and export of extracellular polymeric substances in cyanobacteria. 

I am also passionate about communicating science to the public, drawing scientific illustrations and coding.
