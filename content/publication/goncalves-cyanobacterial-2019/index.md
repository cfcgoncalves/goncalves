abstract: 'Cyanobacteria hold great promise as renewable and sustainable microbial
  cell factories for the production of several chemicals. In the past few years, great
  efforts have been employed to fine-tune metabolic pathways and fluxes toward product
  formation. However, focusing exclusively on the biosynthetic pathways of the target
  molecule, neglects two crucial aspects for the overall production capacity and process
  efficiency: availability of substrates and product secretion. In fact, the molecular
  mechanisms mediating substrate import and product export have been largely overlooked
  in cyanobacteria. In this context, secretion is particularly relevant, as compounds
  of interest may accumulate in the intracellular space, inhibiting production pathways
  and/or inducing toxic effects. In this chapter, we wish to raise awareness of the
  importance of secretion systems in cyanobacteria in the setting of biotechnological
  applications, highlighting what has been done in closely related bacteria, and identifying
  cyanobacterial candidates for improving efficient product export.'
