abstract: 'Evolutionarily conserved circadian clocks generate 24-hour rhythms in physiology
  and behaviour that adapt organisms to their daily and seasonal environments. In
  mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus is the principal
  co-ordinator of the cell-autonomous clocks distributed across all major tissues.
  The importance of robust daily rhythms is highlighted by experimental and epidemiological
  associations between circadian disruption and human diseases. BMAL1 (a bHLH-PAS
  domain-containing transcription factor) is the master positive regulator within
  the transcriptional-translational feedback loops (TTFLs) that cell-autonomously
  define circadian time. It drives transcription of the negative regulators Period
  and Cryptochrome alongside numerous clock output genes, and thereby powers circadian
  time-keeping. Because deletion of Bmal1 alone is sufficient to eliminate circadian
  rhythms in cells and the whole animal it has been widely used as a model for molecular
  disruption of circadian rhythms, revealing essential, tissue-specific roles of BMAL1
  in, for example, the brain, liver and the musculoskeletal system. Moreover, BMAL1
  has clock-independent functions that influence ageing and protein translation. Despite
  the essential role of BMAL1 in circadian time-keeping, direct measures of its intra-cellular
  behaviour are still lacking. To fill this knowledge-gap, we used CRISPR Cas9 to
  generate a mouse expressing a knock-in fluorescent fusion of endogenous BMAL1 protein
  (Venus::BMAL1) for quantitative live imaging in physiological settings. The Bmal1Venus
  mouse model enabled us to visualise and quantify the daily behaviour of this core
  clock factor in central (SCN) and peripheral clocks, with single-cell resolution
  that revealed its circadian expression, anti-phasic to negative regulators, nuclear-cytoplasmic
  mobility and molecular abundance.'
