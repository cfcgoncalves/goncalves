abstract: Cyanobacteria were the first organisms ever to perform oxygenic photosynthesis
  and still significantly contribute to primary production on a global scale. To assure
  the proper functioning of their primary metabolism and cell homeostasis, cyanobacteria
  must rely on efficient transport systems to cross their multilayered cell envelope.
  However, cyanobacterial secretion mechanisms remain largely unknown. Here, we report
  on the identification of 11 putative inner membrane translocase components of TolC-mediated
  secretion in the unicellular cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Gene-inactivation
  of each of the candidate genes followed by a comprehensive phenotypic characterization
  allowed to link specific protein components to the processes of protein export (as
  part of the type I secretion system) and drug efflux (part of the resistance-division-nodulation
  efflux pumps). In addition, mutants in genes sll0141, sll0180 and slr0369 exhibited
  alterations in pilin glycosylation, but pili structures could still be observed
  by transmission electron microscopy. By studying the release of outer membrane vesicles
  (OMVs), an alternative secretion route, on mutants with impaired secretory functions
  we suggest that the hyper-vesiculating phenotype of the TolC-deficient mutant is
  related to cell envelope stress management. Altogether, these findings highlight
  how both classical (TolC-mediated) and nonclassical (OMVs-mediated) secretion systems
  are crucial for cyanobacterial cell homeostasis.
