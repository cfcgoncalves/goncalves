 abstract = {The interest in using cyanobacteria for biotechnology is rising steeply not only because of their ease of cultivation and genetic manipulation but also because of their high degree of metabolic plasticity. Typical approaches include fine-tuning of native metabolic pathways or the expression of heterologous enzymes toward the goal of product formation. Many of the examples found in the literature represent proof-of-concept works, but a more holistic view of the biological system is required to secure higher production rates and efficiencies. In this context, a topic that has deserved insufficient attention is product export, particularly relevant as the intracellular accumulation of compounds of interest may inhibit production pathways and induce toxicity. The knowledge regarding players and mechanisms involved in product secretion in cyanobacteria is lagging far behind compared to what is known in industrial workhorses such as Escherichia coli. In this chapter, we present and discuss secretion systems described for cyanobacteria and closely related bacteria, identifying cyanobacterial candidates for potentially improving product export. In addition, focus is also given to a largely overlooked secretion system, the release of membrane vesicles, which holds enormous potential in numerous applications.},
