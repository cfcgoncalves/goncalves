abstract: The interest in using cyanobacteria for biotechnology is rising steeply
  not only because of their ease of cultivation and genetic manipulation but also
  because of their high degree of metabolic plasticity. Typical approaches include
  fine-tuning of native metabolic pathways or the expression of heterologous enzymes
  toward the goal of product formation. Many of the examples found in the literature
  represent proof-of-concept works, but a more holistic view of the biological system
  is required to secure higher production rates and efficiencies. In this context,
  a topic that has deserved insufficient attention is product export, particularly
  relevant as the intracellular accumulation of compounds of interest may inhibit
  production pathways and induce toxicity. The knowledge regarding players and mechanisms
  involved in product secretion in cyanobacteria is lagging far behind compared to
  what is known in industrial workhorses such as Escherichia coli. In this chapter,
  we present and discuss secretion systems described for cyanobacteria and closely
  related bacteria, identifying cyanobacterial candidates for potentially improving
  product export. In addition, focus is also given to a largely overlooked secretion
  system, the release of membrane vesicles, which holds enormous potential in numerous
  applications.
