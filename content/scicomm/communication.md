 I have also participated in science communication events hosted by the university and aimed at high-school students and the local community. Throughout the activities, I have successfully discussed basic concepts of life sciences and exchanged experiences and first impressions about my training programme with prospective students. I find communication to be a rewarding activity as it allows me to share my passion for science with others and contribute to a more informed society. I am confident I can take the best advantage of the vibrant opportunities offered by this joint PhD training programme to inspire the wider public about science.

  The circadian clock is involved in the temporal orchestration of several molecular networks involved in the daily maintenance of cartilage homeostasis (e.g. matrix synthesis and chondrocyte proliferation). In my PhD project, I am investigating the feasibility of utilising temperature pulses to restore circadian oscillations in cartilage. I am also evaluating the effect of the temperature treatment on tissue homeostasis.
