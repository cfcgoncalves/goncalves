## **Public Engagement**

  Articular cartilage experiences daily loading/unloading cycles that influence its biophysical and biochemical properties. These are associated with circadian rhythms of activity/rest. Indeed, autonomous circadian clocks have been found in mouse cartilage as well as in human primary chondrocytes. Disruption of circadian clocks in chondrocytes has been associated with cartilage degeneration in both mice and humans. Moreover, circadian rhythms become dampened during ageing and chronic inflammation.

  The circadian clock is involved in the temporal orchestration of several molecular networks involved in the daily maintenance of cartilage homeostasis (e.g. matrix synthesis and chondrocyte proliferation). In my PhD project, I am investigating the feasibility of utilising temperature pulses to restore circadian oscillations in cartilage. I am also evaluating the effect of the temperature treatment on tissue homeostasis.
